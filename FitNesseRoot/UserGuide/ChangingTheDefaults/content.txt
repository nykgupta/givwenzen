Where as we tried to follow the idea of convention over configuration we also gave the ability to change the defaults.

Defaults:

 * [[Step class location][.UserGuide.ChangingTheDefaults.StepClassLocation]] = bdd.steps package and all sub packages
 * [[Calling steps that are in another step classes][.UserGuide.ChangingTheDefaults.CallingOtherSteps]]
 * [[Instantiate steps with some custom state][.UserGuide.ChangingTheDefaults.CustomStateForSteps]]
 * [[Step class instantiation strategy][.UserGuide.ChangingTheDefaults.StepClassInstantiation]]
