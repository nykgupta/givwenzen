Step methods are methods in a step class that are annotated with @!-DomainStep-! with a string value that is a regular expression that will be used to do matches against the text in the test.

e.g.

the test:

|given|i have entered 50 into the calculator|

would be annotated like
{{{
   @DomainStep("i have entered (\\d+) into the calculator")
   public void enterNumber(int number) {
      numbers.add(number);
   }
}}}
the captures ((\\d+) in this example) form the match or passed as [[parameter][.UserGuide.StepMethods.ParameterConversion]] to the method

!-GivWenZen-! throws an exception when steps are redundant.

!-GivWenZen-! does not throw an exception, at this point, when there are ambiguous steps.
