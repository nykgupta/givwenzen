!3 Cucumber Background
Using Suites and !-SuiteSetUp-! can give you the equivalent of a background or at least a similar idea.

!3 Cucumber Feature
!-GivWenZen-! does not have features at this point.  Since I originally wanted to use it with !-FitNesse-! the closest idea to a Feature would be a suite.  I try to organize a suite of tests around a feature.  Suites can have a !-SuiteSetUp-! and a !-SuiteTearDown-! to have state that is shared between scenarios (test pages) in !-FitNesse-!

!3 Cucumber Scenario
!-GivWenZen-! does not have the idea of a scenario at this point.  If you use it with !-FitNesse-! the closest idea to a is a test page.  I try to organize such that each test page contains a single scenario.  Each page can have a !-SetUp-! and !-TearDown-! page similar to a scenario in Cucumber.

!3 Cucumber Tags
!-GivWenZen-! does not have the idea of a tag at this point.  If you use it with !-FitNesse-! you can use the !-FitNesse's-! built tag support found in the properties of a page.
